Good Question promotes best practies for online community management and guides newcomers to properly handle realtime online medias.

* Promote good communications practices

* Provide tools for online communities to productized and automated help (e.g. IRC bot)
  and migitate `help vampires <http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/>`_ problem

* Help communities to scale up communications and make newcomers feel home

Community scalability problem
-------------------------------

The site was established after the author had struggled many years managing online communities
and the constant decrease in the quality of communication

    There will be no explosion when forums reach the breaking point. There is just a quiet negative feedback effect: people unsubscribe from the lists, or leave the IRC channel, or at any rate stop bothering to ask questions, because they can see they won't be heard in all the noise. As more and more people make this highly rational choice, the forum's activity will seem to stay at a manageable level. But it is staying manageable precisely because the rational (or at least experienced) people have started looking elsewhere for informationâ€”while the inexperienced people stay behind and continue posting. In other words, one side effect of continuing to use unscalable communications models as the project grows is that the average quality of both questions and answers tends to go down, which makes it look like new users are dumber than they used to be, when in fact they're probably not.


From `Karl Fogel <https://twitter.com/kfogel>`_: `How to Run a Successful Free Software Project <http://producingoss.com/en/growth.html>`_

By following modern internet best practices, like Github collaboration,
providing easy-to deploy automated tools and guidance to newcomers I believe
we can stop the negative feedback loop and increase the quality of communication and online community happiness permanently.

Inspiration
------------

There exist famous `How To Ask Questions The Smart Way <http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html>`_
by Eric Steven Raymond and Rick Moen. However, even though this guide has been constantly updated,
it was written for the world of 2004 and the relevancy has dimished during the years.

* The text is long and not suitable for contemporay ADHD content consumption of Twitter generation

* The is based on cases of old UNIX technology that is irrelevant for modern Internet geared technology discussion
  (no, you should not install Mutt or turn off HTML)

* It is not packaged, distributed or maintained in a beautiful and easily to extend format
