IRC, internet relat chat, is a chat network protocol for real-time chatting.

* There exist many separate IRC networks, `Freenode <http://freenode.net/>`_ being most popular

* IRC networks have channels which equal to chat rooms. Except that channels may contain
  very large number of participants, from hundreds to thousands.

* Due to its nature, IRC has a different etique from normal face-to-face chat and
  other internet conversations. What you have learnt elsewhere in your life may not apply
  to IRC chat, so it is suggested you study etique guide on this site.

How to connect to IRC chat
-------------------------------------

People connect to IRC using a client software which can be

* desktop software (Quassel, mIRC)

* terminal software (irssi)

* web based chat software (Freenode hosted chat, Mibbit)

You take a connection to a server and a join a channel. Usually this happens by typing the following to
IRC status window::

    /join #goodquestion

Make it your home and stay there
----------------------------------

By default, IRC is privacy aware and you do not get any messages from the time
before you have joined a channel.

If you are serious about a project you should get an IRC client which holds the connection
even if you close your computer. The most common way to achieve this are running an irssi terminal client on an UNIX server where you connect through SSH. Alternatively, you can set up a Quassel in distributed mode, where you have a Quassel core to running on a server continuosly.


Other IRC networks and history
-------------------------------

The usage of IRC has been eclipsed by raise of other social networks (Twitter, Facebook).
Social aspects of IRC, like keeping in touch with your friends, are declining.

However, IRC still has its use as it has distributed nature, not controlled by one company,
it scales for very large real-time chats (hundreds of participants) and it has proven track record
of serving communities well.
