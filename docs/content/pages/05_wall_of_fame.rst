Here is my collection of examples how *not to* ask questions.

Example 1:
----------------------------------------------------------------

.. container:: question

    <questiondude> Module ZPublisher.Publish, line 235, in publish_module_standard  Module zope.publisher.skinnable, line 46, in setDefaultSkin
    <questiondude> how to solve?

* Lack on context

* No introduction

* Not full error information

Here we also can demostrate what happens when you lack an automating greeting bot::

    <communitymember> boyfriend: please take time to read plone.org/help#irc first
    <communitymember> thank you
    <questiondude> ???

* There Could have been critical time saving, on the both the community and person behalf if the person asking question
  in the first place would have been forced to introduce himself to question asking etique

.. container:: question

    ...
    Is there any good assembly generation module for Python?
    ..
    For example, when I try to compile this simple sub code with PyAsm it gives me a "Segmentation fault (core dumped)":

* The person it the question has found a tool which answer his question, but still seeks a new one

* Instead, he is having an issue with it or operating it improperly. He does not seek answer to solve the real problem (Segmentation fault).

* Lack of knowledge how to interact with the community (contacting the tool authors)
