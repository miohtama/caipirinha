GoodQuestion IRC bot provides a greeter to bot your online community as software-as-a-service.

* Register your channel and personal greeting message by adding a file on Github through Github Fork, Edit and Pull Request mechanism

* The robot will greet all IRC channel joiners with the instructions how to ask questions

* The robot is not noisy; the same people are not greeted again
