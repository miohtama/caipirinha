                         Have the chat open at least this an hour to see if anyone can answer to your question.

                         <strong>People might not be online</strong>.
                         Large number of chat participants doesn't mean that those people are at the front of the computer.
                         Also, consider timing: weekends and evening are usually more quiet.

                        <strong>Try alternative non-real-time forums</strong>.
                        If you don't get any answers in chat try non-real-time forums.
                        If you are looking for a off-the-shelf answer for a specific question try
                        <a href="stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a> (programming) and
                        related <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">StackExchange Q&amp;A sites</a>.
                        Often a community also has an public mailing list or a forum where you can post your question
                        and wait for few days for the answer.

            <p>
                Don't ask permission to ask questions. Don't ask personal councelling or send private messages to people unless they know you. Just greet, ask your question, wait for answer and enjoy smalltalk meanwhile.

                         Asking permission to ask question or asking if someone knows about something does
                         not contain any details which might raise interest towards your issue. Go directly to your point if you want to discuss a matter.

                        making it quicker for answer to other people. They only add noise to the discussion channel.

                         Sending private messages to people or asking a personal mentoring could be considered
                         rude.

        People participate online communities voluntary. It's not a help desk and they are not on payroll.
        They do it, because they <strong>love what they do</strong>. But they are only human; they have limited knowledge andbad moods for unrelated reasons. Even if you don't get answers don't let it ruin your day. Smile and try again later.
