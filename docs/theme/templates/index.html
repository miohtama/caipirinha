                         <strong>Who are you</strong>?
                         People will spend more effort to help you if you tell upfront that you are inexperienced, student
                         or doing this voluntary instead of for your work. By knowing your experience level, people
                         don't make failed assumptions how technically deep answers you can understand.

                         <strong>How did you end up doing this</strong>?
                         Usually the technical problem is just an obstacle towards a greater goal.
                         But you might have taken wrong route. Tell your larger goal and why you ended up
                         with this problem. It might be that you have a wrong angle to the problem in the first place.

                        With slim voluntary resources answering the question initiative in problem solving is appreciated.

                         not contain any details which might raise interest towards your issue. Go directly to the point of the matter you want to discuss.
