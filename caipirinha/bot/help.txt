I am Miss Help, a friendly IRC bot helping you with your quest to the internet community.

I serve at many channels. You do not have need to private message me, unless you are
an admin of the IRC channel.

Private message commands I know are

* help: this message

* auth: Get an admin link for a channel you are in

* auth [channel]: Get an admin link for a specific IRC channel
